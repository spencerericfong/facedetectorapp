Welcome to **Not Face Blind**! This is a simple web application I made from scratch that detects and outlines faces in user-provided images. This is my very first full stack web application, which I developed after teaching myself web development starting from zero knowledge whatsoever. The front end and website design was built completely in **React.js**, using a few royalty-free and/or open source assets along with the CSS toolkit [TACHYONS](https://tachyons.io/). The server is a RESTful API I created using **Node.js** and **Express.js**. And lastly, I organized the user database in a relational database using **PostgreSQL**. The face detection API itself is powered freely by [Clarifai](https://www.clarifai.com/). Feel free to check out the [**source code**](https://github.com/spencerericfong/not-face-blind) for more documentation.

A quick disclaimer about registering and signing in: **I DO NOT USE YOUR DATA FOR ANYTHING AT ALL.**

The only reason registering and signing in is a necessity to use the app is because I needed a reason to create a database to go along with this application. Feel free to provide fake names and fake emails all you'd like, because I'm not going to be using any of that data for anything. I probably won't even be looking at any of it, unless the site breaks or someone runs into some bugs.

With that all said, I hope you like the site and app! Please contact me about any issues, or feel free to open an issue yourself on the Github repository itself. Thanks for visiting!
