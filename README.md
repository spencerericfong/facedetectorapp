**Not Face Blind** is a simple web application that detects faces in images. In order to use the application, users must register, and login upon subsequent visits to the site. However, **USER DATA IS NOT USED FOR ANYTHING**. Feel free to use fake information.

*This is the **front-end** repository. For the API, see: [not-face-blind-api](https://github.com/spencerericfong/not-face-blind-api).*

The front-end of this project was built in Javascript, using **React.js**. For the website styling and design, I used the CSS toolkit [**Tachyons**](https://tachyons.io/), along with minimal amounts of traditional CSS. The face detection service is provided freely by [**Clarifai**](https://www.clarifai.com/). The site itself is hosted and deployed by [**Heroku**](https://heroku.com/).
